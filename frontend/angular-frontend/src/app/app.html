<!-- we can add a component directly using its selector, like this-->
<!-- find the selector name in the @Component decorator for that component-->
<!-- they're all app-<COMPONENT NAME> by default-->

<app-header />
<!--
 Keep the router-outlet tag on your page

 The "pages" to which we navigate will display in the router-outlet.

 Anything that's "static" (on every page) can be called directly
-->
<router-outlet />
<!-- Any components nested inside the component that is added to the router-outlet will get loaded as well-->
<app-footer />
